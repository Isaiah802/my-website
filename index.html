            <h2>The Light You Give</h2>
            <p>
                In every dawn, you are the light,<br>
                That pushes shadows far from sight.<br>
                When skies grow dark, and hopes grow thin,<br>
                You lift me up, you help me win.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your steady hands, your caring heart,<br>
                A quiet strength, a work of art.<br>
                No mountain seems too tall to climb,<br>
                When you are standing by my side.

                Through every storm, through every tear,<br>
                Your love remains, forever near.<br>
                A guiding star, a constant grace,<br>
                That lights the path I dare to trace.

                I hear your voice, your gentle call:<br>
                "Keep going, love, you're strong, you'll see,"<br>
                Because you always believe in me.
